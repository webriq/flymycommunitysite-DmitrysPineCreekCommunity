The golf course, common areas, parks and trails link a variety of housing types including custom and semi-custom homes, production single-family homes, town homes and apartments.   Architecture and landscape are key elements of the Pine Creek theme and identity. The architectural theme borrows from the predominant architectural styles of historic Colorado Springs and adapts them in a contemporary form. Craftsman, Prairie, Spanish Eclectic, and European Cottage are the only architectural styles permitted in Pine Creek. Landscaping, walls, lighting and other streetscape elements have been selected to provide continuity throughout the community.   The purpose of the Pine Creek Village Association is to ensure a continuing quality neighborhood environment from the design and maintenance of the homes to the quality of life of its residents, and to ensure the highest possible property values.","aboutbg":"/img/aboutfly_bg.png"}],"updatedDate":"2018-01-22T09:57:14.183Z"}
